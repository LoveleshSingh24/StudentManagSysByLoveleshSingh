# StudentManagSysByLoveleshSingh

This is project based on student managment system perticularly created by using OOPM(object oriented programming methodology).
There is no use of file handeling,
It include uses of class,data abstraction,data incapsulation,class methods and some basic concepts of OOPM. 


I will share some more similar project in future using concept of "file handeling" and "OOPM" .


Hope you will like my project ,feel free to share necessary/innovative changes...
